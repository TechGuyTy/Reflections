	What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized, the git file is added and you are then able to store commits and other versions. This is needed
in order to use git and all of its features to keep track of multiple versions.

	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. Files in the staging area are being prepared to
 be commited but have not yet been. This makes it possible to revisit each file before making a commit. The value is in how you're able to
double check your logic before having to commit to a set of commits.?

	How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
After something is changed, you may put it in the staging area. You may then check out the staging area and see if that's what you really want to add to the final repository.

	What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
Some situations could include adding different versions to an existing program or trying out new and experimental features. Branches will help by having different logical pathways for the user to look through and save while still maintaining a master branch for the core components.

	How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
The diagrams allow a visual representation that will easily allow someone to follow all of the logical changes and different features that may be included in a program. Any unaccessible files will be shown in a diagram.
