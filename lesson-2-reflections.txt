	What happens when you intialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
When a repository is initialized, the git file is added and you are then able to store commits and other versions. This is needed
in order to use git and all of its features to keep track of multiple versions.

	How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is an intermediate area between the working directory and the repository. Files in the staging area are being prepared to
 be commited but have not yet been. This makes it possible to revisit each file before making a commit. The value is in how you're able to
double check your logic before having to commit to a set of commits.?
